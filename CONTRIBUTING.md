# How to contribute
We highly appreciate your effort to contribute, but we recommend you [discuss](https://github.com/websight-io/starter/discussions) to a maintainer before spending a lot of time making a pull request that may not align with the project roadmap.

## Feature Requests
Feature Requests by the community are highly encouraged. Feel free to [submit a new one](https://github.com/websight-io/charts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

## Bugs
