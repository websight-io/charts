## Feature Requests
Feature Requests by the community are highly encouraged. Feel free to [submit a new one](https://github.com/websight-io/websight-ce-helm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

## Bugs
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/websight-io/websight-ce-helm/issues) to manage bugs. We keep a close eye on them. Before filing a new issue, try to ensure your problem does not already exist.
